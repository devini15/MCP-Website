<h2 style="color:red">Fixes</h2>
<ul class=fixes>
  <li>Rolling [8][6][3] (in that order) on a Thrice Dice would end the game automatically</li>
  <li>One of the Floating Islands NPCs would say a slur we weren&#39;t aware of (sorry!)</li>
  <li>Turn Skipper made players unreasonably upset</li>
  <li>Creepers were far too easy to maneuver in Creeper Catchers</li>
  <li>Players who's IGNs contained the letter &quot;Q&quot; could not roll above 5 (per dice block)</li>
  <li>Devin&#39;s RNG was far too good</li>
</ul>
