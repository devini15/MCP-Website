      <p>
        Center Park is a board that takes place in a city surrounding an urban park.
        In this city, players travel on the right side of the road.
        When entering an intersection, there are always two exits available.
        Right away, the East and West exits at every intersection are open.
        When a player lands on a magenta spot these exits close and the North and South exits open.
        The exit states swap every time a player lands on a magenta spot or uses a Traffic Whistle.
        This board includes two Star Sellers because of the high number of spaces.
        The Custom Bonus Star is the “Ticket Star”.
        You can buy tickets from the Ticket Masters at the casinos on the corners of the map.
        At the end of the game, one random player's ticket is drawn and that player receives the Ticket Star.

      <p>
        Airborne Isles is a board that revolves around quests. Players can go on quests and collect items for rewards.
        The Custom Bonus Star for this board goes to the first player to complete the most laps around the board.
        This board also includes teleporters which players can use for a fee to move around the board.
        Magenta spots will trigger a player spot scramble.
        There is lots of strategy in this board when it comes to moving around and at the same time,
        despite the board appearing large, it is quite traversable.
        Overall, this is a more advanced board that has original concepts not found in traditional Mario Party boards.

        A more classic-style Mario Party board that uses 2x2 spaces instead of 3x3.
        The general movement is in a clockwise square. There are three shops on the board each with 8 item slots.
        This board’s main feature is Bew’s ship which is a way to steal Coins from opponents when passed
        or steal a Star at a cost of 40 Coins. Magenta spots can teleport you to a random spot, make you take a tumble,
        or disable the ship for two turns. The Custom Bonus Star, the “Coin Thief Star”,
        is awarded to the player that steals the most Coins throughout the game.
        This includes stealing through Bew, using coin stealing items, or using the TNT cannon at the lighthouse.
        Overall, this board is more beginner-friendly and similar to what you’d expect in Mario Party.

        In this board the Star Seller is static and offers up to 3 Stars at a time.
        There is a 6 turn day and night cycle. During the day, the Stars cost 20 Coins.
        During the night, the Star cost can vary from 5, 10, 15, 30, or 40 Coins.
        The board is designed such that item spaces and board events are mostly on the outside,
        whereas the star seller is in the middle. This board also has three passable board events:
        The Key Shop, Guardian Boss Fight, and Hardini's Star Duplication Trick.
        Magenta spaces open or close gates when landed on.
        The Custom Bonus Star goes to the player who used the most items.
        Overall, this board is meant to be better for shorter games compared to other boards,
        as players can earn lots of stars in a short amount of time.
        However, this board can be exciting in long games too!

        Candyland puts players in a world full of treats where they need to make it to the Star Seller at the end of the
        path. The Star Seller remains in one spot for the whole game.
        This board has two main paths that lead to the Star Seller at the end. One is a shorter path.
        The other is a longer path that includes two board events.
        The board events include memorizing a path and finding a spot in a gingerbread basement.
        The Bonus Star for this board is the Shopping Star which is awarded to the player that spends the most Coins on
        items in shops. This is a fairly simple, straightforward linear board.

        The largest board of them all! This massive board includes nearly 200 spaces and pellets scattered about.
        The warps on the sides of the board can be used to traverse around easier. Additionally,
        there are power pellets that enable players to steal Coins and send their opponents back to the start if passed
        on the board. This board includes two Star Sellers and a few blocked off paths that can be opened.
        The Custom Bonus Star is the Pellet Star which is awarded to the player that collects the most pellets throughout
        the game. Pellets do not respawn. Overall, this board has plenty of options for travel which gives opportunity
        for various strategies.

        This board resembles a Japanese theme with various decor around the board.
        The shape of the board is a small circle inside a larger circle with paths that connect each other.
        At each intersection, the player must move right or left and cannot go straight.
        You can buy up to five Stars at a time on this board, but with each additional Star costing more.
        Because of the difficulty of reaching the Star Seller,
        the Custom Bonus Star is given to whoever gets the most Star transactions.
        There is always a trade-off for buying more stars with each interaction with the Star Seller.
        This board also includes shops and free item pickups on the outside,
        with a small inside circle that can be used to make your way around the map.
        In addition, this board includes a Trident Time Trial, a Music Disc Challenge, and a Mastermind Challenge,
        all of which award Coins. And finally, this board includes a chaotic magenta space that can shuffle around
        players' Coins or Stars. There's a good amount of strategy on this board
        and always somewhere exciting to travel to.

        This board is a vast cave with some interesting secrets going on.
        The board is shaped with a larger outer circle with elevators around.
        Featuring three board challenges including brewing a potion, killing spiders, and mining for ores in a dark cave,
        you'll always find yourself collecting Coins for the altars.
        In the middle of this board, there are four different altars you can visit.
        The altars allow you to dump in Coins and receive random items as a reward at a lower expected cost than the shop.
        You can increase your sacrificial power by collecting an enchantment shard from a brown mushroom hut and
        dropping it into the altar. The Bonus Star for this board gets awarded to whoever throws in the most Coins into
        the altars. And finally, this board has an option to visit Bew where you can steal Coins or a Star from an
        opponent.

        Warps! Warps! Warps! This board involves various teleporting across the map.
        Inspired by classic Mario Party, this board has a combination of Mario Party and Minecraft themed builds.
        There are three challenges where you can earn Coins from including a color warp maze,
        defusing a cannon, and painting a canvas with boots.
        Around the board there are 3 pairs of warps that you can use for a fee to teleport across the map.
        In addition to this, there are two additional magenta warp pairs that are used automatically when landing on the
        space. On top of this, Bew is included in the center of the board.
        The Custom Bonus Star is awarded to whoever uses the most warps.
        This includes warp tolls and magenta spaces but not the green pipe in the middle of the map.
        Overall, in this board it's slightly easier to obtain Stars compared to other boards
        due to the warping options and the overall layout.

        This music-themed board looks simple at first, but has it's share of surprises.
        The Star price on this board starts at 20 coins and can change to 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 40 coins when a
        player lands on a metronome space. This board has the largest variety of magenta spaces among all the boards.
        Magenta spaces do the following:<br>
        Piano- Gives or takes 5 Coins from all players<br>
        Drum- Launches player to a random space<br>
        Chair- Launches player to a random player<br>
        Horn- Launches player to Star space<br>
        Metronome- Changes Star price<br>
        In addition to the crazy magenta spaces, there are two board challenges; one that tests your mashing,
        and another that tests your pitch. The Bonus Star for this board is the Luck Star and is awarded to whoever
        lands on the most yellow, black, and chance time spaces.

        This board works differently than other boards. To obtain Stars, you must invest your Coins into plots.
        If you have the most Coins invested in a plot, you are the owner of that plot and can get up to 3 Stars
        depending on how many Coins are invested in that plot. The Star rewards are as follows per plot (4 Players):<br>
        1-34 Coins: 1 Star<br>
        35-69 Coins: 2 Stars<br>
        70+ Coins: 3 Stars<br>
        In addition to this, there is a fifth plot in an area away from the main board.
        This plot always awards the owner 3 Stars. However, this plot is rather hard to get to.
        You can get on the path by entering the manhole on the board.
        The manhole can be opened from the magenta space immediately before it or by using Ghost/Ghoul Mode to get through.
        This board also features a picnic challenge and Pablo The Pincher who reinvests Coins from opponents' plots into yours.
        The Bonus Star for this board is the Diversification Star and is awarded to whoever's smallest plot investment is the greatest.
        Overall, the plot mechanic is different from the other boards and can be chaotic with lots of room for strategy.

        Roam around on a table with feasting Giants. On this board, Giants will request food items.
        Deliver the food item being requested and you will be rewarded with a Star.
        First you must make it to the food item and pick it up,
        then you must make it back to the Giant that made the request.
        Be careful, after you grab the food item, players can pass you and steal it for themselves.
        In addition to the food, there are two small challenges that can be played to earn coins;
        the Water Bucket Clutch Challenge and the Sesame Seed Bun Challenge.
        The Bonus Star for this board is awarded to the player that initiates the most duels, micro duels,
        and battle minigames. Lofty Luncheon is a small board including a unique food gimmick and is well suited for beginners.
