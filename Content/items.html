NOTICE: Before adding more to this page, we should figure out how it is going to be styled. I was thinking that the
in-game item descriptions could be in the existing white text, but I'm not sure what to do about additional details.
My Ideas:
1. Any extra details are in small yellow text under the in-game description
2. Extra details are not displayed on this page, instead having a "More" button in each box beside the enhanced toggle
